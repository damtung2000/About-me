                    <p>
                        I am an Accounting and Finance student currently studying in APU.
                        
                        <strong>Whiplash PCR</strong> based methods of biomolecular computation (BMC) are 
                        well-known to suffer from a simple form of self-poisoning known as 
                        <a href="../2_html5_sectioning/backhybrid.html">back-hybridization</a>. However, an 
                        optimally re-engineered WPCR-based architechture, <em>Displacement
                        Whiplash PCR</em> (DWPCR) has been proposed and experimentally validated. 
                        In addition to attaining a near-ideal
                        efficiency, DWPCR's ability to support isothermal operation near room
                        temperatures eliminates the need for thermal cycling, and opens the
                        door for biological applications.

                            In my first year, I joined the Business Case Challege with a group of friends who are all first year students. The competition requires each team to devise a business plan as the solution for the case in 21 hours. As we lacked experience and knowledge about the competition, we got eliminated on the first round. However, it was a great experience for all of us and we had a great time working together.

                            I got selected to be a Teaching Assistant for Professor Lanka's Programming course. It has always been my dream to work with programming. The job has given me invaluable experience as both a Teaching Assistant and a programmer. Through helping students to fix their projects, I learned a lot about the many ways a simple task can be done in programming.

                    <p>
                        The efficiency of WPCR is critically compromized by <a href="bh.html">Back-hybridization</a>,
                        a common form of self-poisoning which has been 
                        shown to render massively-parallel WPCR infeasible.
                        Direct experimental verification has also been
                        reported. <mark>Since this effect cannot be eliminated via strand encoding,
                        the fundamental re-engineering of WPCR was required, ultimately leading
                        to the invention of DWPCR.</mark>
